# Introduction

Web application is based on a website brief, I was given to build a website from, for a city and guilds exam in web design I took in 2012.

The task was that I worked for Mannerings Music Agency which is a company that advertises music for sale on the lnternet. As a web designer for the company I was have been asked to design a website to advertise the available music for sale.

I was given full artistic license to produce a website that will inspire and engage potential clients. I was to demonstrate my knowledge and eipertise and provide a wide-ranging website demonstrating these services. Also to advise on what content is permissible and how best to create their site to enable a quick download on the internet and maintain as small a storage requirement as possible.

I used elements learned from a publication called PHP & MySQL: Novice to Ninja, 6th Edition by Tom Butler and Kevin Yank and Udemy video tutorial Make a Spotify Clone from Scratch: JavaScript PHP and MySQL by Reece Kenney to create a web application using the Model View Controller design pattern that allows users to listen to audio tracks, search for favourite audio tracks, leave reviews of audio tracks and albums and login into and register user accounts.
