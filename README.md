# Introduction

Web application is based on a website brief, I was given to build a website from, for a city and guilds exam in web design I took in 2012. 

The task was that I worked for Mannerings Music Agency which is a company that advertises music for sale on the lnternet. As a web designer for the company I was have been asked to design a website to advertise the available music for sale.

I was given full artistic license to produce a website that will inspire and engage potential clients. I was to demonstrate my knowledge and eipertise and provide a wide-ranging website demonstrating these services. Also to advise on what content is permissible and how best to create their site to enable a quick download on the internet and maintain as small a storage requirement as possible.

I used elements learned from a publication called PHP & MySQL: Novice to Ninja, 6th Edition by Tom Butler and Kevin Yank and Udemy video tutorial Make a Spotify Clone from Scratch: JavaScript PHP and MySQL by Reece Kenney.
